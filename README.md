# A Superteam fork of The Grid's referance data explorer. 
This uses our The Grids graphQL endpoint which can be found over at [docs.thegrid.id](https://docs.thegrid.id/)

Right now this takes a very profile focused 'lens' view at our data. In the future, this may expand to other lenses. To understand how we look at lenses, [see this](https://docs.thegrid.id/lenses-at-the-grid-18)

## Useage
To be able to customise this to your usecase, the following is a very simple check list of things you need to change:
- [x] Update hard filters on site-config.ts which limits which list of profiles loads, also update header and description names for tab information 
- [x] Upload your logos and favicon (before deployment to avoid caching issues)
- [ ] Maybe remove the clone repo button
- [x] Update the banner text in the banner file
- [x] Update the header info
 

### Installation
