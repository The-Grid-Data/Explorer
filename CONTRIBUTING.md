# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

## What is a contributor license agreement?

When a project receives a contribution, it must be clear that both the contributor has the rights to contribute the content. The legal agreement for doing this is callsed a Contributor License Agreement, and comes in two flavours. (1) for humans, and (2) for corporates.

## The Grid's perspective

We choose not to utilize CLAs on our own open source repositories at The Grid, in order to have a frictionless experience for developers to contribute.

### What license do contributions come under?

Each contribution comes under the project license. In the case of the Explorer, this license is the MIT License.

### What can I contribute under the project license?

You should only send a pull request for changes that you have the right to submit to the project, which means generally it must be your own work, and if it is work for your employer, that your employer is happy with the contribution to the project. It should not contain obscene material, or other people's work, or confidential information.
